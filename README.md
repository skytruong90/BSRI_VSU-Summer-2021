# What is this?
This is my REU project I did for Valdosta State University and I did my research in Fault Containment Algorithm with Dr. Dasgupta

# What is an REU?
Research Experiences for Undergraduates are competitive summer research programs in the United States for undergraduates studying science, engineering, or mathematics. The programs are sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and are hosted in various universities.

# How competitive was this program? 
REU programs are highly competitive. This program in particular recently new and was open to only VSU students. They are normally research positions that are fully-funded, which last 6-10 weeks during the summer.
